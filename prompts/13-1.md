# Step 13.1: Git Commit Graph Visualization Enhancement

You are enhancing the keystroke visualization with visual git-style commit graphs that serve as unique digital signatures for each post.

CONTEXT: Step 13 implemented basic keystroke timeline visualization. Now enhance it with proper git-style commit graphs that look like actual git repositories, making each post's keystroke pattern a unique visual fingerprint.

## REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. Create Git Graph Components:
- `GitCommitGraph.tsx` - Main interactive git graph component
- `MiniGitGraph.tsx` - Compact version for post banners  
- `GitNode.tsx` - Individual commit dot with branch connections
- `GitBranch.tsx` - SVG path lines connecting commits

### 2. Implement Keystroke-to-Git Algorithm:
- Process keystroke data into logical "commits" (typing bursts)
- Calculate branch points based on pause patterns
- Generate SVG paths for connecting lines between commits
- Create deterministic patterns (same data = same graph always)
- Handle different writing patterns (steady vs burst typing)

### 3. Mini Graph for Post Banners:
- **Location**: In green verification banner at `/posts/{slug}`
- **Size**: Compact horizontal (100-150px wide, 40-60px tall)
- **Purpose**: Quick visual "fingerprint" of writing authenticity
- **Integration**: Next to existing verification badges

### 4. Enhanced Timeline Graph:
- **Location**: Replace simple dots in "Typing Timeline" at `/posts/{slug}/keystrokes`
- **Size**: Full-width interactive graph
- **Features**: Hover details, clickable commits, zoom functionality
- **Purpose**: Detailed exploration of writing process

## VISUAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:

### Git Graph Elements:
```
Timeline: ●───●─────●───●───●
          │   │     │   │   │
Commits:  T   P     T   T   C
          │   │     │   │   │
Time:     ├───┼─────┼───┼───┤
         0s  5s   15s 18s 20s
```

### Color Coding:
- 🟢 **Green commits**: Active typing sessions (keydown events)
- 🟡 **Yellow nodes**: Pause periods (>2s gaps)
- 🔴 **Red commits**: Correction bursts (backspace sequences)
- 🔵 **Blue nodes**: Major milestones (paragraph breaks, etc.)

### Branch Patterns:
- **Straight line**: Steady typing flow
- **Branching**: Simultaneous editing (corrections during typing)
- **Merging**: Return to main flow after corrections
- **Thickness**: Line thickness represents typing intensity

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:

### 1. Data Processing Algorithm:
```typescript
interface GitCommit {
  id: string
  timestamp: number
  type: 'typing' | 'pause' | 'correction' | 'milestone'
  keystrokes: number
  duration: number
  position: { x: number, y: number }
  branches: string[] // Connected commit IDs
}

function processKeystrokesToGitGraph(keystrokes: Keystroke[]): GitCommit[] {
  // Group keystrokes into logical commits
  // Calculate branch points and connections
  // Generate positions for visual layout
  // Return commit graph data
}
```

### 2. SVG Rendering System:
- Use SVG for crisp, scalable graphics
- Responsive viewBox for different screen sizes
- Smooth curve paths between commits
- Interactive hover zones

### 3. Component Architecture:
```
GitCommitGraph (main container)
├── GitBranch (connecting lines)
├── GitNode (commit dots)
└── GitTooltip (hover details)
```

### 4. Integration Points:
- **Post banner**: Add `<MiniGitGraph />` to verification card
- **Timeline page**: Replace dot list with `<GitCommitGraph />`
- **Backend**: Ensure precise timestamp data for graph generation
- **Types**: Add git graph interfaces to `types/index.ts`

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:

### Performance Optimizations:
- Limit graph complexity for large datasets (sample/group commits)
- Use `useMemo` for expensive graph calculations
- Implement virtual scrolling for long timelines
- Lazy load detailed graph data

### Responsive Design:
- **Desktop**: Full detailed graph with all features
- **Tablet**: Simplified graph with key commits only
- **Mobile**: Minimal graph focusing on major patterns

### Accessibility:
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation for interactive elements
- High contrast mode support
- Alternative text descriptions of patterns

## DELIVERABLES:

### 1. Core Components:
- `/components/ui/git-commit-graph.tsx`
- `/components/ui/mini-git-graph.tsx`
- `/components/ui/git-node.tsx`
- `/components/ui/git-branch.tsx`

### 2. Algorithm Implementation:
- Keystroke data processing logic
- Git graph generation algorithm
- Position calculation for visual layout
- Branch connection logic

### 3. Integration Updates:
- Enhanced post verification banner with mini graph
- Updated keystroke timeline with visual git graph
- Responsive design across all screen sizes
- Performance optimizations for large datasets

### 4. User Experience Features:
- Interactive hover states showing commit details
- Clickable commits to jump to specific timestamps
- Smooth animations for graph transitions
- Export functionality for sharing visual fingerprints
