# Step 4: Basic Editor Component

You are implementing the core writing editor for Signify with basic functionality.

CONTEXT: This is step 4 of 16. Previous steps established auth and document management. Users can create/list documents. Now add the writing interface.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create the Editor React component:
   - Clean, distraction-free interface (inspired by Medium/Notion)
   - Title input field that updates document title
   - Large textarea for content with proper styling
   - Word count and character count display
   - Auto-expanding textarea that grows with content

2. Add editor styling:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for clean design
   - Typography that's comfortable for long-form writing
   - Clean, minimal interface without distractions

3. Implement basic save functionality:
   - Save button that sends content to backend
   - Visual feedback for save status (saving, saved, error)
   - Debounced input to avoid excessive API calls
   - Handle save errors gracefully

4. Create editor page routing:
   - Route like /documents/:id/edit
   - Load existing document content
   - Handle new document creation flow
   - Proper error handling for non-existent documents

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement controlled components for forms
- Use Inertia.js for navigation and form submission
- Follow existing component patterns in the app

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Component tests for editor functionality
- Request specs for save operations
- System tests for complete editing flow

DELIVERABLES:
- Editor React component with styling
- Document edit routes and controller actions
- Save functionality with status feedback
- Comprehensive test coverage

Create an editor that feels responsive and comfortable for writing, setting the foundation for keystroke capture in the next step.
