# Step 14: Data Access Features

You are implementing raw data access and verification tools for complete transparency.

CONTEXT: This is step 14 of 16. Keystroke visualization shows human typing patterns. Now provide raw data access for independent verification.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add raw data download:
   - JSON export of complete keystroke data
   - CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
   - Include all timestamps, keys, and metadata
   - Proper filename with post identifier

2. Create verification API:
   - Public API endpoint for keystroke data
   - JSON format with clear documentation
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - CORS headers for third-party verification tools

3. Add data format documentation:
   - Clear explanation of data structure
   - Example verification scripts
   - Guidelines for third-party analysis
   - Technical specifications for developers

4. Implement verification tools:
   - Built-in data integrity checker
   - Keystroke authenticity validator
   - Statistical analysis of typing patterns
   - Export verification report

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Create RESTful API endpoints for data access
- Use efficient serialization for large datasets
- Add proper caching and rate limiting
- Document API with clear examples

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- API endpoint tests for all formats
- Data integrity and format validation tests
- Rate limiting and security tests
- Documentation accuracy tests

DELIVERABLES:
- Raw data download functionality
- Public verification API
- Comprehensive documentation
- Built-in verification tools

Provide complete transparency and third-party verification capabilities for maximum trust.
