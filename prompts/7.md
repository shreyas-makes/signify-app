# Step 7: Auto-save System

You are implementing automatic saving with keystroke data for the Signify editor.

CONTEXT: This is step 7 of 16. The editor captures keystrokes and prevents paste. Now add reliable auto-saving to preserve work and keystroke data.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Implement auto-save timer:
   - Save document content and keystrokes every 30 seconds
   - Reset timer on manual save
   - Pause auto-save when user is inactive
   - Resume auto-save when typing resumes

2. Add save status indicators:
   - "Typing..." when user is actively writing
   - "Saving..." during save operations
   - "Saved" with timestamp after successful save
   - "Error saving" with retry option on failures

3. Implement robust error handling:
   - Retry failed saves automatically (3 attempts)
   - Preserve keystroke data on save failures
   - Show user-friendly error messages
   - Allow manual retry with error details

4. Optimize save operations:
   - Only save when content has changed
   - Batch keystroke data efficiently
   - Minimize API calls and payload size
   - Handle slow network connections gracefully

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Use React hooks for timer management
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Add proper error boundaries
- Use debouncing for performance

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Tests for auto-save timing and behavior
- Error handling and retry logic tests
- Performance tests for large documents
- Network failure simulation tests

DELIVERABLES:
- Auto-save system with visual feedback
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Optimized save operations
- Comprehensive test coverage

Create an auto-save system that users can trust to preserve their work and keystroke data.
