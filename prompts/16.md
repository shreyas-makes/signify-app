# Step 16: Launch Preparation

You are preparing Signify for launch with essential security and basic deployment readiness.

CONTEXT: This is step 16 of 16. The MVP is feature-complete and polished. Focus on making it secure and deployable, not optimized.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Essential security measures:
   - CSRF protection for all forms (already in Rails)
   - Basic input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting for public endpoints
   - Secure session handling

2. Basic deployment preparation:
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Database migration safety
   - Asset compilation for production
   - Basic error monitoring setup

3. Launch-ready features:
   - Terms of service and privacy policy pages
   - Contact/support information
   - Basic admin tools for managing content
   - Simple analytics (page views, user signups)

4. Essential testing:
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Security testing for auth and data access
   - Basic load testing with realistic data

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Use Rails security defaults
- Keep deployment simple (single server is fine)
- Focus on core security, not performance optimization
- Prepare for real users, not massive scale

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Test complete signup → write → publish → share flow
- Verify security measures work correctly
- Test deployment process

DELIVERABLES:
- Secure, deployable application
- Essential legal pages
- Basic monitoring and admin tools
- Proven deployment process

Launch an MVP that's secure, complete, and ready for real users to love.
