# Step 13: Keystroke Visualization

You are implementing the keystroke timeline and replay functionality for post verification.

CONTEXT: This is step 13 of 16. Public posts display content with verification badges. Now add the actual keystroke visualization that proves human authorship.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Build keystroke timeline component:
   - Git-style commit graph showing writing progression
   - Timeline with timestamp markers
   - Visual indicators for typing, pauses, and edits
   - Word count progression over time

2. Implement character-by-character replay:
   - Play/pause controls for keystroke replay
   - Speed controls (1x, 2x, 5x, 10x)
   - Seek functionality to jump to specific times
   - Display current character being typed

3. Add typing pattern visualization:
   - Show natural human typing rhythms
   - Highlight pause patterns between sentences
   - Display backspace/correction patterns
   - Visual proof of no copy-paste operations

4. Create verification statistics:
   - Average typing speed (WPM)
   - Pause patterns and analysis
   - Edit frequency and patterns
   - Total time spent writing

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Use React for interactive timeline components
- Implement efficient data processing for large keystroke sets
- Add smooth animations for visual appeal
- Optimize performance for replay functionality

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Component tests for timeline functionality
- Performance tests with large keystroke datasets
- Replay accuracy and timing tests
- Cross-browser compatibility tests

DELIVERABLES:
- Interactive keystroke timeline
- Character-by-character replay system
- Typing pattern visualization
- Verification statistics

Create compelling visual proof of human authorship that readers can explore and verify.
