# Step 3: Document Foundation

You are implementing basic document management for Signify writers.

CONTEXT: This is step 3 of 16. Previous steps created data models and authentication. Users can now register and login. The app uses Rails + Inertia.js + React.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create document CRUD operations:
   - DocumentsController with index, show, create, update, destroy
   - Proper authorization (users can only access their own documents)
   - JSON API responses for Inertia.js

2. Build document listing interface:
   - React component showing user's documents
   - Display title, status, created date, word count
   - Create new document button
   - Edit/delete actions for each document

3. Add basic document creation:
   - Simple form to create new document with title
   - Automatic slug generation from title
   - Default to 'draft' status
   - Redirect to document after creation

4. Implement document deletion:
   - Soft delete for published documents (status change)
   - Hard delete for drafts
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Follow Rails RESTful conventions
- Use Inertia.js for seamless page transitions
- Implement proper authorization with before_actions
- Create reusable React components

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Request specs for all CRUD operations
- Authorization tests (users can't access others' documents)
- System tests for the complete user flow
- Tests for slug generation and uniqueness

DELIVERABLES:
- DocumentsController with full CRUD
- React components for document listing and forms
- Proper authorization and security
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Updated routes

Create a solid document management foundation that will support the editor in the next step.
