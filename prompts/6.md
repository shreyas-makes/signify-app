# Step 6: Paste Prevention

You are implementing paste prevention in the Signify editor to ensure all content is manually typed.

CONTEXT: This is step 6 of 16. The editor captures keystrokes. Now prevent paste operations to guarantee human authorship.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Block all paste operations:
   - Prevent Ctrl+V / Cmd+V keyboard shortcuts
   - Block right-click context menu paste
   - Prevent drag-and-drop text operations
   - Block browser Edit menu paste

2. Add user-friendly feedback:
   - Show helpful error message when paste is attempted
   - Toast notification: "Paste blocked to ensure authenticity"
   - Explain why paste is disabled
   - Suggest manual typing for content integrity

3. Handle edge cases:
   - Block middle-click paste on Linux
   - Prevent autocomplete/autofill in editor
   - Block programmatic paste via clipboard API
   - Handle browser extensions that might paste

4. Create paste detection system:
   - Detect suspicious rapid text input
   - Flag potential paste-like behavior
   - Log paste attempts for security analysis
   - Maintain user experience during legitimate typing

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Use comprehensive event prevention
- Implement graceful error messaging
- Add security monitoring without blocking workflow
- Test across multiple browsers and platforms

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Tests for all paste prevention methods
- User experience tests for error messaging
- Cross-browser compatibility tests
- Edge case testing for paste detection

DELIVERABLES:
- Complete paste prevention system
- User-friendly error handling
- Paste attempt logging
- Cross-browser compatibility

Ensure paste prevention is robust but doesn't interfere with legitimate writing.
