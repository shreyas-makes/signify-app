# Signify MVP Development Checklist

A focused checklist for building a Simple, Lovable, Complete MVP of Signify - a keystroke-verification writing platform.

## Phase 1: Foundation (MVP Core)

### Database Models & Migrations
- [x] Enhance User model with `display_name` field
- [x] Create Document model with title, content, slug, status, user association
- [x] Create Keystroke model with event tracking (type, key_code, character, timestamp, sequence)
- [x] Set up model associations and validations
- [ ] Create basic database seeds for development

### Enhanced Authentication
- [x] Update registration form to include display name
- [x] Add authentication helpers for document access
- [x] Implement proper authorization (users access only their documents)
- [x] Test authentication flows

## Phase 2: Core Writing Experience

### Document CRUD Operations
- [x] Create documents controller with full CRUD
- [x] Implement document listing interface
- [x] Add document creation form
- [x] Build document edit interface
- [x] Implement basic delete functionality

### Writing Editor Component
- [x] Build clean, distraction-free writing interface
- [x] Implement auto-expanding textarea with good typography
- [x] Add word/character count display
- [x] Add basic save functionality
- [ ] Make it work well on mobile

## Phase 3: Keystroke Magic

### Real-time Keystroke Tracking
- [ ] Implement keydown/keyup event listeners
- [ ] Add precise timestamp recording (millisecond precision)
- [ ] Track key codes, characters, and document positions
- [ ] Create efficient data structure for rapid typing
- [ ] Implement batch transmission to backend

### Paste Prevention System
- [ ] Block all paste operations (Ctrl+V, right-click, drag-drop)
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messaging
- [ ] Test paste prevention thoroughly

## Phase 4: Auto-save & Publishing

### Auto-save System
- [x] Implement 30-second auto-save timer with intelligent pausing
- [x] Add save status indicators ("Typing", "Saving", "Saved", "Error")
- [x] Build robust error handling with automatic retry
- [x] Test auto-save reliability

### Enhanced Document Model
- [ ] Add publishing workflow fields (published_at, public_slug, word_count)
- [ ] Implement status workflow (draft → published)
- [ ] Add automatic slug generation with uniqueness
- [ ] Create content analysis methods (word count, reading time)

## Phase 5: Publishing & Sharing

### Publishing Workflow
- [ ] Create publish button with pre-publish validation
- [ ] Implement immutable content snapshots on publication
- [ ] Add minimum content requirements
- [ ] Build post-publish workflow with shareable URLs

### Public Routing & Views
- [ ] Implement SEO-friendly URLs (/posts/:public_slug)
- [ ] Create public post discovery and listing
- [ ] Add basic meta tags for social sharing
- [ ] Implement clean, readable typography for published content
- [ ] Add verification badges and trust indicators

## Phase 6: The Killer Feature - Keystroke Visualization

### Keystroke Visualization (The WOW Factor)
- [ ] Build interactive timeline showing writing progression
- [ ] Implement character-by-character replay with playback controls
- [ ] Create typing pattern visualization
- [ ] Add verification statistics (WPM, pause patterns)
- [ ] Make it smooth and delightful to watch

### Data Access Features
- [ ] Implement raw keystroke data export (JSON format)
- [ ] Create simple verification API
- [ ] Add basic data integrity validation

## Phase 7: MVP Polish

### Essential UX Polish
- [ ] Add loading states for save operations
- [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Ensure mobile-responsive design for key flows
- [ ] Add delightful keystroke replay experience
- [ ] Create smooth document publication flow

### Basic Security & Deployment
- [ ] Ensure CSRF protection for all forms
- [ ] Add basic input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add basic rate limiting for public endpoints
- [ ] Environment variable configuration
- [ ] Basic deployment preparation

## Phase 8: Launch Preparation

### Launch Essentials
- [ ] Terms of service and privacy policy pages
- [ ] Contact/support information
- [ ] Basic error monitoring setup
- [ ] Simple analytics (page views, user signups)

### Testing
- [ ] Test complete signup → write → publish → share flow
- [ ] Verify keystroke capture works reliably
- [ ] Test paste prevention across browsers
- [ ] Verify deployment process

## MVP Success Criteria

### Simple
- ✅ Writers can register, write, and publish in under 5 minutes
- ✅ Readers can immediately see keystroke verification
- ✅ No complex features or overwhelming options

### Lovable
- ✅ Smooth, responsive writing experience
- ✅ Delightful keystroke replay that makes people say "wow"
- ✅ Clean, beautiful interface that feels professional
- ✅ Satisfying feedback for all user actions

### Complete
- ✅ Full workflow from idea to verified publication
- ✅ Robust paste prevention that actually works
- ✅ Reliable keystroke capture and storage

## What's NOT in MVP

**Removed for Focus:**
- Advanced accessibility features (WCAG compliance, screen readers)
- Performance optimizations (caching, CDN, query optimization)
- Advanced analytics and monitoring
- Complex user management features
- Mobile apps or PWA capabilities
- Advanced keyboard shortcuts
- Dark/light theme support
- Bulk operations and advanced document management
- API documentation and third-party integrations
- Advanced security monitoring

**MVP Timeline:** 6-8 weeks for core functionality + 2-4 weeks polish

**Launch Criteria:** When someone can write a post, publish it, and show friends the keystroke replay - and they think it's amazing.
